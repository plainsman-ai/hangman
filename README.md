# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
## As of Milestone 3
The file milestone_3 returns a list of 5 pre-selected fruit and chooses one from random. It asks the user to guess a letter and tells them whether this is in the name of the fruit or not (it is not case-sensitive). Each time it selects a different kind of fruit. This will be changed.
